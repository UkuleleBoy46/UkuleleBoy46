### UkuleleBoy46 Solutions is Now Hiring
We're looking for JavaScript and HTML & CSS developers to expand our team and assist in projects. As I (UkuleleBoy46) work with all of these skillsets, I will be able to guide the team and provide clear instructions. We do all our work for free and open source and we can't pay you, but you'll gain valuable coding experience, learn how to work with a team, and build your resume. We are currently working on a large/scalable project, but we may also have smaller projects to work on that we'd like your help with (taking approx. 1-3 days on average).
