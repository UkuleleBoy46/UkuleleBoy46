We are non-profit and do all our work for free and open source and we can't pay you, but you'll gain valuable coding experience, learn how to work with a team, and build your resume. We are currently working on a large/scalable project, but we may also have smaller projects to work on that we'd like your help with (taking approx. 1-3 days on average).
