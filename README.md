Hi, I'm UkuleleBoy46, a self-taught developer in the United States. I like reading, spending time in nature, gardening, and researching health & nutrition. I have a public bot and a few servers.

# About me

- My favorite programming language is Javascript. I also use HTML and CSS, and in the past I've used some Python.

- I mostly make small projects, such as [bookmarklets](https://github.com/UkuleleBoy46/Bookmarklets/) and HTML web tools (some of which then turn into larger projects).

- I make Discord bots and run a [Discord server](https://discord.gg/QQQRBNDj9b) to help people code (with a focus on Discord bots) and make their Discord servers better.

- I speak English, I'm learning Spanish, and I know a little German.
